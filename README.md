Once, long ago, @WarDrummer and I had the idea of porting something like Javadoc
to C++. And so we did. This is that. There are two versions. They're both here.
I think the second one works pretty well - it's self-documented with cppdoc,
which is packaged here in the `cppdoc2/cppdoc/` directory. But this code was
written in like 2002, so... who can say.
